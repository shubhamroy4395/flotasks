You are working on the FloTasks productivity web app.

The app has a dark mode, but it currently suffers from usability issues:
- Many content blocks (like “Today’s Tasks”, “Top 3 Goals”, and “Gratitude Journal”) use pale greys or low-contrast whites that blend into the background.
- Some text (like “Click any line to add a task” or goal labels) are barely readable.
- Buttons like “Add More” lack hover/active contrast and don’t stand out from the layout.
- White boxes on a dark background without shadows or borders lack depth and feel invisible.
- There’s a lack of visual cues for interaction (hover, focus, selection).

## ✅ Task:
Please revise the dark mode to follow **UI/UX accessibility best practices** and improve **visual clarity, contrast, and readability**.

## 🎯 Goals:
1. Improve **text readability** with higher contrast ratios.
   - Use `#F1F1F1` or `#E0E0E0` for light text, and avoid full white `#FFFFFF`.
   - Avoid placing light grey text over light grey containers.
   - Use `font-weight: 500+` for better readability.

2. Give **white/grey containers a subtle shadow or border**:
   - Add `box-shadow` or a `1px solid #333` border to cards like “Goals for Today”, “Gratitude Journal”, etc.

3. Improve **interactivity of buttons**:
   - Add hover states (e.g., darken background slightly).
   - Add active/pressed states with animations like `transform: scale(0.98)`.

4. Adjust **input and list visibility**:
   - Increase visibility of empty input areas (like unchecked task list rows).
   - Add `:hover` states for empty lines so users feel where to click.

5. Ensure **consistent spacing and container hierarchy**:
   - Use 8px-based spacing.
   - Make containers like “How are you feeling” and “Reminders” pop slightly with a soft glow or background tint.

6. Use **color-coded semantic design**:
   - Blue (Tasks Completed), Green (Goals), Purple (Priority), Orange (Progress) are great — but increase their brightness or saturation slightly for dark mode.

7. Add **dark-mode specific styling logic**:
   - Use a top-level `dark-theme` class and scope styles to it:
     ```css
     .dark-theme .card {
       background-color: #1E1E1E;
       color: #EAEAEA;
     }
     ```

## 💡 Optional Enhancements:
- Allow user to adjust contrast from settings panel.
- Add subtle animation when toggling between light and dark mode.
- Use CSS `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` for system-based dark mode toggling.

## 🎨 Suggested Colors for Dark Mode:
| Element                | Suggested Color        |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| Background             | `#121212`              |
| Card background        | `#1E1E1E` – `#222222`   |
| Primary text           | `#EAEAEA`              |
| Secondary text         | `#B0B0B0`              |
| Button text            | `#FFFFFF`              |
| Accent colors (icons)  | Keep blue, green, purple, orange — just brighten a bit |

## 🧪 Validation:
Once done, please test the layout:
- On both desktop and mobile.
- For users with vision issues — use a contrast checker (aim for 4.5:1 minimum for text).
- Try keyboard navigation to ensure focus visibility.

Do not proceed if:
- Any text appears faint or unreadable.
- Containers visually "disappear" into the background.
- Buttons have no hover/active state.
